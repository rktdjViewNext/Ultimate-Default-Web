# DefaultWeb _ Working Directory
This repository is the the default web project that I se in some training courses.
If you are takin one of my courses, this is the right place to be or the default web porject.

If toy are looking for a fancy web template, there are much better resources available to you via a simple search for "free boostrap/html5 website templates"

Also note: This is not a the basic setup. This code has been modified during the production of one of my courses. If you want the bare starte, make sure to actually use the DefaultWeb Proyect.
